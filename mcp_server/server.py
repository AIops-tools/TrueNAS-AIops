"""MCP server wrapping TrueNAS AIops operations (stdio transport).

Thin adapter layer: each ``@mcp.tool()`` function (in ``mcp_server/tools/``)
delegates to the ``truenas_aiops`` ops package and is wrapped with the
truenas-aiops ``@governed_tool`` harness (audit / budget / undo / risk-tier).

Standalone, self-governed TrueNAS SCALE operations (preview).
For TrueNAS SCALE only.
